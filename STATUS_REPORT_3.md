## STATUS REPORT 3

1. The user can now submit their food, fat, calories, and proteins and it will be 
added to the database. If they submit their food on the same day, the data in the 
database will then be updated. The user can also now set a goal and that will also
be posted to the database.

2. Syntax Errors. So many Syntax Errors. Also trying to figure out what the functions
in the Mongo do exactly has been a struggle. We also did not have enough time to implement
all our goals from the last status report because we are all in comp15 and this last 
homework is hard.

3. Our goals for the next week are to implement the Google graphs API to display our
data and send weekly emails that will remind the user to complete the goal.
