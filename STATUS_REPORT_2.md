##STATUS REPORT 2
##Team 2

#Accomplished:
-We built up our database this week. We wrote some POST routes and connected
our application to Mongo. We got most of the way through the database but it
is still not quite as functional as we would have hoped at this point.

#Struggles:
-Just about everything dealing with Mongo gave us problems. We had to rewrite
our entire database structure a few times just to be able to store and access
anything. All of the Mongo functions gave us trouble because we wanted to
update some data while leaving other data the same.

#Goals for Next Week:
-Finish Server (Event listeners, weekly database management, send emails)
-Progress Bar
-Google Charts API

NOTE: We updated the README again with a note about our participation.
